## Overview
This document defines the test runner implementation for the LFS/BLFS Build Scripts Wrapper System, providing automated test execution and result management.

## Runner Architecture

### 1. Core Components
```yaml
components:
  executor:
    - Test discovery
    - Test scheduling
    - Resource management
    - Result collection
  
  manager:
    - Queue management
    - State tracking
    - Resource allocation
    - Error handling
  
  reporter:
    - Result aggregation
    - Metrics collection
    - Report generation
    - Alert management
```

### 2. Execution Modes
```yaml
execution_modes:
  sequential:
    type: "ordered"
    parallelism: false
    resource_control: "strict"
    suitable_for:
      - System tests
      - Integration tests
      - Resource-intensive tests
  
  parallel:
    type: "concurrent"
    parallelism: true
    resource_control: "managed"
    suitable_for:
      - Unit tests
      - Independent tests
      - Performance tests
  
  distributed:
    type: "networked"
    parallelism: "multi-node"
    resource_control: "coordinated"
    suitable_for:
      - Large-scale tests
      - Cross-system tests
      - Load tests
```

## Test Execution

### 1. Test Discovery
```yaml
test_discovery:
  patterns:
    - "test_*.py"
    - "*_test.sh"
    - "test_*.bats"
  
  organization:
    unit: "tests/unit/"
    integration: "tests/integration/"
    system: "tests/system/"
    performance: "tests/performance/"
  
  metadata:
    - Test category
    - Dependencies
    - Resource requirements
    - Execution order
```

### 2. Test Scheduling
```yaml
test_scheduling:
  priorities:
    critical: "immediate"
    high: "next available"
    normal: "scheduled"
    low: "background"
  
  dependencies:
    tracking: "graph-based"
    resolution: "topological"
    validation: "pre-execution"
  
  resources:
    allocation: "dynamic"
    monitoring: "continuous"
    optimization: "adaptive"
```

## Result Management

### 1. Result Collection
```yaml
result_collection:
  formats:
    - junit-xml
    - json
    - yaml
    - custom
  
  data_points:
    - Execution time
    - Resource usage
    - Success status
    - Error details
  
  aggregation:
    - By category
    - By component
    - By resource
    - By status
```

### 2. Result Processing
```yaml
result_processing:
  analysis:
    - Pattern detection
    - Trend analysis
    - Performance profiling
    - Resource utilization
  
  validation:
    - Expected results
    - Performance thresholds
    - Resource limits
    - Quality gates
  
  reporting:
    - Summary reports
    - Detailed logs
    - Metrics dashboard
    - Alert notifications
```

## Resource Management

### 1. Resource Allocation
```yaml
resource_allocation:
  computation:
    cpu:
      min: "1 core"
      max: "available"
      default: "50%"
    
    memory:
      min: "1GB"
      max: "available"
      default: "4GB"
    
    storage:
      min: "5GB"
      max: "available"
      default: "20GB"
```

### 2. Resource Monitoring
```yaml
resource_monitoring:
  metrics:
    - CPU usage
    - Memory usage
    - I/O operations
    - Network usage
  
  thresholds:
    warning: "80%"
    critical: "90%"
    timeout: "5m"
  
  actions:
    - Resource reallocation
    - Test rescheduling
    - Alert generation
    - Emergency cleanup
```

## Integration APIs

### 1. Runner API
```python
class TestRunner:
    def execute_test(test_spec: Dict[str, Any]) -> TestResult:
        """Execute a single test based on specification."""
        pass
    
    def schedule_tests(test_suite: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> None:
        """Schedule a suite of tests for execution."""
        pass
    
    def collect_results(test_id: str) -> TestResult:
        """Collect results for a specific test."""
        pass
    
    def monitor_resources(test_id: str) -> ResourceMetrics:
        """Monitor resource usage for a test."""
        pass
```

### 2. Reporter API
```python
class TestReporter:
    def generate_report(results: List[TestResult]) -> Report:
        """Generate a test execution report."""
        pass
    
    def analyze_metrics(metrics: List[Metric]) -> Analysis:
        """Analyze collected metrics."""
        pass
    
    def validate_results(results: List[TestResult]) -> ValidationResult:
        """Validate test results against requirements."""
        pass
```

## Quality Integration

### 1. Quality Gates
```yaml
quality_gates:
  execution:
    - All tests discovered
    - Resources available
    - Dependencies met
    - Environment ready
  
  completion:
    - Results collected
    - Coverage met
    - Performance acceptable
    - Resources released
```

### 2. Metrics Collection
```yaml
metrics_collection:
  test_metrics:
    - Execution time
    - Pass rate
    - Coverage
    - Resource usage
  
  system_metrics:
    - CPU utilization
    - Memory usage
    - I/O operations
    - Network usage
```

## Required Resources
1. Test execution environment
2. Resource monitoring tools
3. Result storage system
4. Reporting infrastructure

## Success Criteria
1. Automated test execution
2. Resource optimization
3. Comprehensive results
4. Quality validation
5. Performance monitoring

## Notes
- Runner must be scalable
