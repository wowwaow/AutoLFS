## Metric Categories

### Code Quality Metrics
```yaml
code_metrics:
  complexity:
    cyclomatic:
      tool: "lizard"
      threshold: 15
      weight: 0.3
    cognitive:
      tool: "lizard"
      threshold: 12
      weight: 0.3
    maintainability:
      tool: "radon"
      threshold: "A"
      weight: 0.4
  style:
    format_compliance:
      tool: "clang-format"
      weight: 0.2
    naming_conventions:
      tool: "custom"
      weight: 0.3
    documentation:
      tool: "doxygen"
      weight: 0.5
```

### Build Quality Metrics
```yaml

  compilation:
    warning_count:
      threshold: 0
      weight: 0.4
    error_count:
      threshold: 0
      weight: 0.6
  optimization:
    size_reduction:
      target: "10%"
      weight: 0.3
    speed_improvement:
      target: "5%"
      weight: 0.3
    resource_usage:
      target: "optimal"
      weight: 0.4
```

### Test Quality Metrics
```yaml
test_metrics:

    line_coverage:
      target: "90%"
      weight: 0.3
    branch_coverage:
      target: "85%"
      weight: 0.3
    function_coverage:
      target: "95%"
      weight: 0.4

```

## Collection Methods

### Automated Collection
```yaml
automated_collection:
  frequency: "hourly"
  tools:
    - sonarqube
    - codecov
    - jenkins
  storage:
    format: "json"
    retention: "90d"
    aggregation: "daily"
```

### Manual Collection
```yaml
manual_collection:
  frequency: "weekly"
  reviewers:
    min_count: 2
    expertise: "required"
  documentation:
    format: "markdown"
    templates: "required"
```

## Analysis Rules

### Threshold Analysis
```yaml
threshold_analysis:
  levels:
    excellent:
      score: ">= 90"
      action: "promote"
    good:
      score: "75-89"
      action: "monitor"
    fair:
      score: "60-74"
      action: "review"
    poor:
      score: "< 60"
      action: "remediate"
```

### Trend Analysis
```yaml
trend_analysis:
  window: "30d"
  metrics:
    - quality_score
    - defect_rate
    - test_coverage
  alerts:
    negative_trend:
      threshold: "-10%"
      action: "investigate"
    positive_trend:
      threshold: "+10%"
      action: "document"
```

## Reporting Format

### Metric Report
```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "metric_type": "string",
  "value": "float",
  "threshold": "float",
  "status": "PASS|WARN|FAIL",
  "trend": {
    "direction": "up|down|stable",
    "change_rate": "float"
  }
}
```

### Summary Report
```json
{
  "period": "string",
  "overall_score": "float",
  "metrics": {
    "code_quality": "float",
    "build_quality": "float",
    "test_quality": "float"
  },
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "category": "string",
      "action": "string",
      "priority": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW"
    }
  ]
}
```
