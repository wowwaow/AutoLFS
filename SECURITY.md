## Reporting Security Issues

### Responsible Disclosure

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via:
- Email: [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)
- Private GitHub Security Advisory: [Create Advisory](https://github.com/wowwaow/AutoLFS/security/advisories/new)

Please include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

1. **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
2. **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
3. **Fix Timeline**: Based on severity
   - Critical: 7 days
   - High: 14 days
   - Medium: 30 days
   - Low: Next release

## Security Update Policy

### Update Schedule

- Critical updates: Immediate release
- High severity: Within 1 week
- Regular security updates: Monthly
- Dependencies: Weekly check and update

### Distribution

- Security updates are signed
- Release notes detail security implications
- Direct notifications for critical issues
- Security advisories for all vulnerabilities

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          | Security Updates    |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: | Active            |
| < 1.0   | :x:                | End of Life        |

## Security Best Practices

### System Configuration

1. **Permissions**
   ```bash
   # Set secure permissions
   chmod 644 config.yaml
   chmod 755 scripts/
   ```

2. **File Ownership**
   ```bash
   # Ensure proper ownership
   chown -R root:root /path/to/critical/files
   ```

3. **Access Control**
   - Use principle of least privilege
   - Implement proper user separation
   - Regular permission audits

### Build Process Security

1. **Source Verification**
   - Verify package signatures
   - Check checksums
   - Use trusted repositories

2. **Build Environment**
   - Isolated build environment
   - Clean build directory
   - Verified toolchain

3. **Output Validation**
   - Validate built packages
   - Check for common vulnerabilities
   - Perform security scanning

## Vulnerability Management

### Assessment Process

1. **Initial Triage**
   - Severity assessment
   - Impact analysis
   - Exploitation difficulty

2. **Classification**
   - Critical: System compromise
   - High: Security bypass
   - Medium: Limited impact
   - Low: Minimal risk

3. **Response Timeline**
   ```
   Day 0: Vulnerability reported
   Day 1: Initial assessment
   Day 2: Reproduction confirmed
   Day 3: Fix development starts
   Day 7: Fix released (critical)
   Day 14: Fix released (high)
   Day 30: Fix released (medium)
   ```

### Automated Security Checks

1. **Continuous Scanning**
   - Daily dependency checks
   - Weekly full system scan
   - Monthly penetration testing

2. **Security Workflows**
   ```yaml
   # Example security workflow
   security:
     scans:
       - dependency_check
       - sast_analysis
       - container_scan
     frequency: daily
     notifications: true
   ```

## Security-Related Configuration

### Required Settings

```yaml
security:
  # Minimal required security settings
  minimum_tls_version: 1.3
  enforce_https: true
  secure_headers: true
  content_security_policy: strict
```

### Recommended Options

```yaml
security:
  # Additional recommended settings
  rate_limiting: true
  fail2ban_enabled: true
  audit_logging: true
  mfa_required: true
```
