  - [ ] Vim and Markupsafe
  - [ ] Jinja2 and Systemd
  - [ ] Dbus and Man-DB
  - [ ] Procps-ng and Util-linux
  - [ ] E2fsprogs
- [ ] Clean and verify each package build

### 6. System Configuration (Chapter 10)
- [ ] Create /etc/fstab
- [ ] Build Linux kernel
- [ ] Set up GRUB bootloader
- [ ] Create network configuration
- [ ] Configure system hostname
- [ ] Set up system clock
- [ ] Configure Linux console
- [ ] Create /etc/shells
- [ ] Configure systemd

### 7. System Finalization
- [ ] Create essential users and groups
- [ ] Set up basic security
- [ ] Generate final documentation
- [ ] Create system backup
- [ ] Verify boot sequence
- [ ] Test core system functionality

## Error Handling and Recovery
1. Build Failures
   - Automatic build log analysis
   - Checkpoint restoration capability
   - Clean rebuild procedures
   - Dependency validation

2. Space Management
   - Regular space monitoring
   - Cleanup procedures
   - Emergency space recovery

3. Chroot Issues
   - Safe exit procedures
   - Environment restoration
   - Mount point management
   - Process cleanup

4. Network Problems
   - Package cache management
   - Offline build support
   - Download resume capability

## Backup Requirements
1. Critical Stage Backups:
   - After toolchain completion
   - Before chroot entry
   - After temporary tools
   - Before system configuration
   - Final system state

2. Retention Policy:
   - Keep last successful stage backup
   - Maintain full build logs
   - Preserve configuration files
   - Archive package sources

## Success Criteria
1. System Boot:
   - Clean boot to login prompt
   - All core services starting
   - No error messages during boot

2. Functionality:
   - All built utilities working
   - Network connectivity
   - Package management ready
   - User environment functional

3. Validation:
   - Version test script passes
   - Core utility tests complete
   - File permission checks pass
   - No broken dependencies

## Timeline
- Preparation: 1 day
- Initial Toolchain: 2 days
- Temporary Tools: 2 days
- Chroot Setup: 1 day
- System Construction: 4 days
- Configuration: 1 day
- Testing and Validation: 1 day

## Notes
- All operations must use the LFS wrapper system
- Maintain detailed logs of each build step
- Create regular checkpoints for recovery
- Follow LFS book version 12.0 specifications
- Implement strict version control for all packages
