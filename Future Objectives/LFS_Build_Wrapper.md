- [ ] Identify common patterns and functionality
- [ ] Define wrapper script requirements and interface
- [ ] Design error handling and logging system

### 2. Core Wrapper Development
- [ ] Create main wrapper script structure
- [ ] Implement configuration management system

- [ ] Create unified logging system
- [ ] Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Add progress tracking and reporting

### 3. Build Process Integration
- [ ] Implement LFS script integration
- [ ] Implement BLFS script integration
- [ ] Create dependency resolution system
- [ ] Add build order management
- [ ] Implement checkpoint/resume functionality
- [ ] Add validation and verification steps

### 4. Management Features
- [ ] Create script status monitoring system
- [ ] Implement build environment validation
- [ ] Add configuration validation
- [ ] Create cleanup and maintenance routines
- [ ] Implement backup and restore functionality

### 5. Documentation and Testing
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Develop test suite for wrapper functionality
- [ ] Create usage examples and tutorials
- [ ] Document error codes and troubleshooting
- [ ] Create disaster recovery procedures

### 6. BLFS Integration
- [ ] Analyze and document all BLFS package dependencies
- [ ] Create BLFS-specific build order optimization
- [ ] Implement BLFS package selection system
- [ ] Add BLFS-specific validation checks
- [ ] Create BLFS package configuration management
- [ ] Implement BLFS post-installation testing
- [ ] Add BLFS update/maintenance procedures

### 7. Gaming Support Integration
- [ ] Analyze gaming-specific package requirements
- [ ] Create gaming optimization profiles
- [ ] Implement graphics driver management
- [ ] Add gaming-specific library handling
- [ ] Create gaming performance validation tests
- [ ] Implement Steam/Proton integration support
- [ ] Add gaming-specific backup/restore procedures

2. Build process can be started/stopped/resumed
3. Error handling successfully manages common failures
4. Complete build process documentation
5. Successful test suite completion
6. Successful BLFS package integration
7. Gaming performance validation
8. Graphics driver optimization
9. Steam/Proton compatibility testing

## Deliverables
1. Main wrapper script
2. Configuration management system
3. Logging and monitoring tools
4. Documentation and tutorials
5. Test suite and validation tools

## Timeline
- Analysis and Planning: 2 days
- Core Development: 3 days
- Integration: 3 days
- Testing and Documentation: 2 days
- BLFS Integration: 3 days
- Gaming Support Implementation: 2 days
- Final Review and Deployment: 1 day
