# Integration Testing Framework for LFS Script Integration
- **Task ID:** BUILD_INTEGRATION_001
- **Name:** Create Integration Testing Framework for LFS Build Scripts
- **Status:** PENDING
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Required By:** Build Process Integration Phase
- **Dependencies:** LFS_SCRIPT_INTEGRATION_001
- **Description:** Develop and implement a comprehensive testing framework to validate the integration of LFS build scripts with the wrapper system.

## Objectives
1. Create a modular testing framework for LFS script integration
2. Validate script execution and environment handling
3. Ensure proper error propagation and recovery
4. Verify build state preservation

## Required Implementation
1. Test Framework Core:
   - Script execution validation
   - Environment setup verification
   - Build state tracking
   - Error condition simulation
   - Recovery procedure testing

2. Test Suite Components:
   - Unit tests for script wrappers
   - Integration tests for build phases
   - System tests for complete builds
   - Performance benchmarking

3. Validation Procedures:
   - Script output validation
   - Build artifact verification
   - Environment state checking
   - Resource usage monitoring

4. Error Handling Tests:
   - Common failure scenarios
   - Recovery procedures
   - State restoration
   - Log verification

## Success Criteria
- All LFS scripts successfully execute through wrapper
- Build state correctly tracked and preserved
- Error conditions properly detected and handled
- Test coverage meets minimum requirements (90%)
- All critical build paths validated

## Dependencies
- LFS script integration system
- Build state management system
- Logging infrastructure
- Test environment setup

## Integration Points
- Build process management
- Error handling system
- Logging framework
- State management system
