### Task Distribution:
- Framework Setup: 1
- Integration Testing: 1
- System Infrastructure: 1
- Security & Compliance: 1
- System Resilience: 1

### Recommendations:
1. Prioritize QA Framework Setup to enable proper testing infrastructure
2. Implement Cross-Integration Validation early to catch integration issues
3. Consider security compliance requirements throughout development
4. Ensure monitoring infrastructure is in place before major integrations
5. Validate automated recovery procedures during development

### Notes:
- All detected tasks align with project requirements in README.md
