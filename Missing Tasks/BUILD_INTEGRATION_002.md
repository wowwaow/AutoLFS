# Build State Management System
- **Task ID:** BUILD_INTEGRATION_002
- **Name:** Implement Build State Management System
- **Status:** PENDING
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Required By:** Build Process Integration Phase
- **Dependencies:** LFS_SCRIPT_INTEGRATION_001
- **Description:** Create a robust state management system for LFS/BLFS builds to enable checkpoint/resume functionality.

## Objectives
1. Design and implement build state tracking
2. Create checkpoint mechanism for build progress
3. Implement build resume functionality
4. Ensure state consistency across operations

## Required Implementation
1. State Storage System:
   - Build progress tracking
   - Checkpoint creation
   - State serialization
   - Recovery management

2. Checkpoint Mechanism:
   - Automated checkpoint creation
   - Manual checkpoint triggers
   - State verification
   - Consistency checking

3. Resume Functionality:
   - State restoration
   - Environment recreation
   - Dependency verification
   - Progress recovery

4. Validation System:
   - State integrity checking
   - Checkpoint verification
   - Resume validation
   - Environment confirmation

## Success Criteria
- Successful state preservation between builds
- Reliable checkpoint creation and restoration
- Accurate build progress tracking
- Consistent environment recreation
- Proper handling of incomplete builds

## Dependencies
- Build process monitoring
- File system access
- Configuration management
- Logging system

## Integration Points
- Build process manager
- Monitoring system
- Configuration handler
- Error recovery system
