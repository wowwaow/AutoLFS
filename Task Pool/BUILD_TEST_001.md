Assigned To: WARP_AGENT_1

## Description
Implement comprehensive testing procedures and infrastructure for the LFS/BLFS build script integration process, including rollback mechanisms, verification checkpoints, and performance benchmarking.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Integration Testing Framework
- Automated test suite for each integration step
- Test environment setup and teardown procedures
- Integration test scenarios for all build phases
- Test result collection and reporting
- Continuous integration pipeline integration

### 2. Rollback System
- Automated rollback trigger mechanisms
- State preservation during rollbacks
- Recovery procedure validation
- Database/filesystem state restoration
- Environment cleanup procedures

### 3. Verification Checkpoints
- Checkpoint definition framework
- Automated verification procedures
- State validation mechanisms
- Progress tracking integration
- Failure detection and reporting

### 4. Performance Benchmarking
- Baseline performance metrics
- Automated benchmark suite
- Resource usage tracking
- Performance regression detection
- Benchmark result analysis tools

## Dependencies
