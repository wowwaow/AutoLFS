## Timeline
Total Estimated Time: 12 days
- Phase 1: Days 1-2
- Phase 2: Days 3-4
- Phase 3: Days 5-7
- Phase 4: Days 8-10
- Phase 5: Days 11-12

## Dependencies
- System administrator access for setup
- Integration framework completion
- Build system core functionality
- Monitoring system access

## Risks and Mitigations
1. System Access Delays
   - Mitigation: Early coordination with system administrator
   - Fallback: Local development environment

2. Integration Issues
   - Mitigation: Regular integration testing
   - Fallback: Mock interfaces for development

3. Performance Issues
   - Mitigation: Early performance testing
   - Fallback: Optimization phase

4. Resource Constraints
   - Mitigation: Resource monitoring
   - Fallback: Scaled testing environment
