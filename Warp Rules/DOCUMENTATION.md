# Warp Agent System Documentation

This document provides a detailed technical overview of the Warp multi-agent system, its folder structures, commands, and how it integrates with Linux From Scratch (LFS) modular automation workflows.

---

## üìö Overview

The Warp system is designed to coordinate large numbers of autonomous AI agents working in parallel on system-level tasks such as LFS modular builds, documentation generation, task atomization, and self-healing recovery.

It leverages:
- Persistent local files (logs, objectives, agent trackers)
- Structured multi-agent rules
- Core system commands for orchestration
- Modular Linux From Scratch build scripts (based on LFS Documentation AI Framework)

## ‚ú® Documentation Best Practices

To maintain system clarity, the following documentation practices are required:

‚úÖ **Update `DOCUMENTATION.md`** whenever system architecture, folder layout, or agent behaviors change.

‚úÖ **Ensure alignment with `README.md`** so human operators and agents follow the same rules.

‚úÖ **Link objective and task-level documentation** (e.g., add LFS package assessments or automation scripts into the objective files).

‚úÖ **Use structured templates** for:
- Package-level documentation (see LFS framework template)
- Security checklists (e.g., CVE scans, hardening status)
- System cleanup + tidy reports

---

## üèó Example System Workflow

1Ô∏è‚É£ Operator runs `NEW OBJECTIVE` to create a modular LFS build project.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Agents execute `WORK` sessions, each taking one modular task.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Agents write:
- Master progress to `MASTERLOG.md`
- Personal progress (heartbeat) to `agent_<name>.csv`

4Ô∏è‚É£ `STATUS` command generates live reports for human monitoring.

5Ô∏è‚É£ `TIDY` command periodically cleans up unused or completed files.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Completed objectives and tasks are archived, with all logs + artifacts ready for documentation review.

---

## üìä LFS Documentation Integration Example

For each modular LFS chapter or package:
- Provide:
  - Source & integrity details (SHA, GPG, upstream URL)
  - Build + runtime dependencies (explicit, transitive, implicit)
  - Platform-specific configurations (arch flags, kernel requirements)
  - Compiler hardening + reproducibility practices
  - Post-install validation + service management notes
  - Security and CVE management records

- Use the LFS framework‚Äôs checklist and YAML templates to formalize AI-assisted analysis.

---

## üìà Future Extensions

- Add automated SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation.
- Integrate real-time metrics collection (Prometheus/OpenTelemetry).
- Extend `TIDY` to include advanced dependency pruning.
- Build CI/CD pipelines that wrap Warp sessions for continuous automation.

‚úÖ **Maintainers Note:**
`DOCUMENTATION.md` should evolve alongside system updates. Treat this file as the **canonical reference** for both human and AI agents to understand Warp‚Äôs design, workflows, and integration points.
