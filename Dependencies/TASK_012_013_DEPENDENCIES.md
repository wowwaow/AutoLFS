## Execution Order Requirements

### Phase 1: Framework Setup
1. TASK_010_QUALITY_ASSURANCE_FRAMEWORK completion
   - Quality metrics defined
   - Validation rules established
   - Review processes documented

2. TASK_011_TESTING_FRAMEWORK completion
   - Testing infrastructure ready
   - Test tools configured
   - Environments prepared

### Phase 2: Standards and Strategy
1. TASK_012_CODING_STANDARDS
   - Style guides created
   - Documentation requirements defined
   - Review processes established

2. TASK_013_TESTING_STRATEGY
   - Test plans developed
   - Coverage requirements defined
   - Validation procedures documented

### Phase 3: Integration
1. Integration with Build System
   - Apply standards to build scripts
   - Implement test procedures
   - Validate documentation

2. Integration with CI/CD
   - Configure automation
   - Set up validation
   - Implement reporting

## Integration Requirements

### QA Framework Integration
1. Quality Metrics:
   - Code quality measurements
   - Documentation coverage
   - Review process metrics
   - Compliance tracking

2. Validation Procedures:
   - Style guide enforcement
   - Documentation verification
   - Test coverage validation
   - Performance benchmarking

### Testing Framework Integration
1. Test Implementation:
   - Unit test structure
   - Integration test organization
   - System test architecture
   - Performance test setup

2. Coverage Tracking:
   - Code coverage metrics
   - Feature coverage tracking
   - Integration coverage
   - Documentation coverage

## Success Criteria

### Standards Implementation (TASK_012)
1. Complete style guides available
2. Documentation requirements defined
3. Review processes established
4. Tools configured and operational

### Strategy Implementation (TASK_013)
1. Test plans documented
2. Coverage requirements defined
3. Validation procedures established
4. Test environments configured

## Risk Management

### Implementation Risks
1. Tool compatibility issues
2. Integration complexity
3. Performance impact
4. Resource constraints

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Early tool validation
2. Phased integration
3. Performance testing
4. Resource monitoring

## Notes
- Both tasks are critical for quality assurance
- Standards must be established before major development
- Testing strategy must align with build system requirements
- Regular validation of implementation required
