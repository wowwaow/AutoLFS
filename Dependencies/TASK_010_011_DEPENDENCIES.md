## Execution Order Requirements

1. Initial Phase:
   - TASK_005_DOCUMENTATION_TESTING completion
   - Documentation standards established
   - Initial test plans created

2. QA Framework Phase (TASK_010):
   - Quality standards implementation
   - Metrics system setup
   - Monitoring infrastructure
   - Reporting system implementation

3. Testing Framework Phase (TASK_011):
   - Basic testing infrastructure
   - Unit testing framework
   - Integration testing system
   - Performance testing suite
   - Security validation framework

4. Integration Phase:
   - BUILD_INTEGRATION_001-004 integration
   - Cross-component testing
   - System-wide validation
   - Performance benchmarking

## Resource Allocation Strategy

### Development Resources
1. QA Framework (TASK_010):
   - Primary Developer: QA Specialist
   - Support: Documentation Expert
   - Review: System Architect
   - Duration: 5 days

2. Testing Framework (TASK_011):
   - Primary Developer: Testing Specialist
   - Support: QA Specialist
   - Review: System Architect
   - Duration: 4 days

### System Resources
1. Development Phase:
   - Dedicated test environment
   - CI/CD pipeline resources
   - Documentation system access
   - Monitoring system resources

2. Testing Phase:
   - Test execution environment
   - Performance testing resources
   - Security testing infrastructure
   - Results storage and analysis

## Integration Points

### QA Framework Integration
1. Documentation System:
   - Standards implementation
   - Quality metrics
   - Process documentation
   - Review procedures

2. Build System:
   - Quality gates
   - Metrics collection
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error tracking

### Testing Framework Integration
1. Build Process:
   - Pre-build validation
   - Post-build testing
   - Integration testing
   - Performance testing

2. Monitoring System:
   - Test execution tracking
   - Resource monitoring
   - Error detection
   - Results reporting

## Success Criteria

### QA Framework (TASK_010)
1. All quality standards documented
2. Metrics system operational
3. Reporting infrastructure complete
4. Integration points verified
5. Documentation complete

### Testing Framework (TASK_011)
1. All test types implemented
2. Automation system operational
3. Coverage targets met
4. Performance testing ready
5. Security validation complete

## Risk Management

### Dependencies Risks
1. Documentation delays
2. Integration complexity
3. Resource availability
4. Tool compatibility
5. Performance impact

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Regular dependency status review
2. Early integration testing
3. Resource pre-allocation
4. Tool validation phase
5. Performance optimization

## Notes
- Both tasks are critical path components
- Quality standards must be established early
- Testing framework must be extensible
- Regular dependency reviews required
- Resource requirements must be validated
